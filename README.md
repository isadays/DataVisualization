## Data Visualization - Common plots refresher

| Plot                    | Description                                                                                      | Use Case(s)                                                                                                                                               |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Line Plot (Time Series Plot) | A line plot connects data points with straight lines, typically used to display trends and changes over time. | Suitable for visualizing continuous data over a continuous time period. Useful for identifying patterns, trends, and fluctuations in data.                 |
| Bar Chart               | A bar chart represents data using rectangular bars of varying lengths, with the height or length of each bar proportional to the value it represents. | Ideal for comparing discrete categories or groups. Useful for visualizing categorical data and identifying the differences or similarities between groups. |
| Histogram               | A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of a continuous dataset. It groups data into bins and displays the frequency of occurrences within each bin. | Helpful for understanding the underlying distribution of the data, identifying central tendencies, and spotting outliers.                                  |
| Scatter Plot            | A scatter plot displays individual data points as dots in a 2D coordinate system, with one variable on the x-axis and the other on the y-axis. | Useful for examining the relationship between two continuous variables. It helps identify patterns, correlations, clusters, and outliers.                   |
| Pie Chart               | A pie chart divides a data set into slices of a circle, with each slice representing a percentage or proportion of the whole data. | Suitable for displaying parts of a whole and highlighting the proportion of different categories within a dataset. However, it is often advised to use bar charts instead, as pie charts can be less effective in accurately comparing data. |
| Box Plot (Box-and-Whisker Plot) | A box plot shows the distribution of data through five summary statistics: minimum, maximum, first quartile (Q1), median (Q2), and third quartile (Q3). | Helpful for visualizing the spread and skewness of data, identifying outliers, and comparing distributions across different categories or groups.          |
| Heatmap                | A heatmap displays data as colored rectangles, where the color intensity represents the value of the data in a 2D grid. | Suitable for representing data that can be arranged in a matrix or grid-like structure, helping identify patterns, correlations, and trends in large datasets. |
| Area Chart             | An area chart is similar to a line plot but with the area between the line and the x-axis filled with color. It is often used to show cumulative data or data over time. | Ideal for comparing trends and visualizing how different categories contribute to the whole over time.                                                      |
